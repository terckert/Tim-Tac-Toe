# Tim-Tac-Toe

Just messing around with looping structures and comparisons to create a simple game of Tim-Tac-Toe.  It took me awhile 
to wrap my mind around Minimax after a twitch streamer mentioned it. The light clicked when a more learned friend asked
me if I knew what a binary tree was.  That was the missing piece.  

I adapted the code found here: 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory-set-3-tic-tac-toe-ai-finding-optimal-move/ to work with my 
original Tim-Tac-Toe foundation and spent a while debugging it to run properly.  When I get more experience with binary 
trees, I would like to rewrite the AI using my own code and brainpower.
